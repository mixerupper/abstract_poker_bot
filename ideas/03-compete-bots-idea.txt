have bots of varying abstraction "fineness" compete against each other
Bot with kuhn poker like 3. Vs poker with 2. and poker with 10.

Hopefully find that the poker with 10 deciles of hand strength beats 9 beats 8 etc.

Then it just becomes a matter of mapping hands to hand strength deciles and ALSO mapping hand strengths to next-period hand strengths. Like a markov chain of hand strengths/predicted hand strengths.
