can we find a multiplicative weights implementation to work off of?
code up heuristic bots
separate the game from the players hopefully

instead of updating weights each iteration, update every X times with all the data.

go to office hours to discuss idea; 
follow perturbed leader in cfrm

see if roth is available for office hours--apologize for missing parts of the semester

does no regret depend on the opponent? or does it have to be pre-trained.
if no regret chooses the "optimal" strategy but might not properly exploit weak opponents if it's pre-trained.

no regret vs reinforcement learning. online just says that no regret is about minimizing any possible losses while reinforcement learning tries to exploit opponent but can be exploited in turn.


can we just do follow the perturbed leader for cfrm?


robustness checks for sysp
- sensitive to winsorization
- above median/below median
- window of pre-period calculations
- can you market-adjust the volume change in addition to return change?
- look into circulating supply instead of on-chain transactions (correlation of 0.81 though. no change in inferences)

can't I just make consumer demand the exact analogue of cash flows? then information about consumer demand is analogous to information about cash flows. facilitator demand is just a function of consumer demand. assume that consumer demand grows at stable state
